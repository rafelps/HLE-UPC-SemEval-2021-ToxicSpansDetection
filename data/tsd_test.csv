tens years ago i contacted the PDR and suggested that the time might be good to work with alaska on building a gas line.. alaska rejected them without even consideration despite china being flush with cash and hungry for gas.. and set up another infamous boondoggle.. the transcanada-exxon rip off that we are still paying for and have yet to receive anything of value.. hundreds of millions of dollars on studies.. and buyouts.. i hope china says f you alaska.. you are nothing but ignorant people..
"The parallels between the ANC and the Sicilian Mafia are glaring. The ANC has always been run by a few ""families"" who treat the state as 'turf' ; as just one big piggy bank for their self-enrichment. The government basically believes we all just work for them. They aren't a democratic government at all, but use the appearances of democracy to give their entitlement practices a mask of legitimacy. The poor and ignorant have been fooled for so long, but people are slowly coming to the ANC for what it is: a self-serving Mafia!"
"Intel Community: ‚ÄòHow can we work for a President who Undermines our work?‚Äô

Days before taking office, he compared America‚Äôs spies to Adolf Hitler‚Äôs Gestapo.

American spies do not like having their work dismissed by the president. Nor do they appreciate comparisons to Nazi Germany.

Former CIA Director John Brennan made it clear: ‚ÄúThe person who said that should be ashamed of himself,‚Äù Brennan said.

Coats‚Äô predecessor, Gen. James Clapper, called Trump‚Äôs comments ‚Äúa terrible, insulting affront ‚Ä¶ completely inappropriate.‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs opinions are out of step with the conclusions of the agencies he is supposed to be leading.

Not surprising in a treasonous traitor."
"I live in an area that saw major flood damage in 2013, including areas that were very unexpected. Trump's reversal is just plain stupid."
Elaine Marie Jeffers sounds like a sociopath üòï.
A rock has more mental horsepower than the indubitably ignorant. And more integrity as well. They're largely very dishonest people who repeat the same lies over and over. Just like their üçä hero.
"Ha ha, HILLARY LOST. All you hillary fools need to be rounded up and put in prison along with your leader. You are all anti--American scum.

"The media is crooked and biased. It's pretty obvious. And they don't seem to care what we think about them. They can influence enough idiots to get their way, they'll do it.

Rabidly anti-Canadian troll.
I wish this moron would have been shot to death by the US soldier instead of the other way around. I hope that 10 million is given to the soldier's family who actually deserve it.

No but most forget that there are a ton of Opel & Vauxhaul (Gm ) and Fords sold in Europe. Some of which are some of Europes largest selling models.Ford sold over 1 million cars in Europe in 2015 while GM sold almost as many. Trump is an idiot that is going to cost American taxpayers jobs and money and likely drag us into it as well. When you have a team of people that no practically nothing of what they are supposed to represent then it will end very bad.

How on Earth did this dumb association get made between such pageantry and people in the military without it getting laughed out of the room on the first day? It doesn't even pass the laugh test....the idea that because someone at some event involving ENTERTAINMENT doesn't do the proper rituals at the proper time would be insulting to those in the military? Ridiculous."

No reporter  has ever mentioned the support of the atrocities committed by Batista supported and sanctioned by the U.S. government  Done to protect callous landowners of sugar plantations from their own workers. The States sent in their Marines several times to put down sugar plantation workers.

The U. S. dominated and directed all aspects of life in Cuba from the end of the Spanish War to Castro's overthrow of Batista.. Castro would not take directions from the Americans to put Cuba under American thumbs so they made 20 attempts to kill him.

A doctrine that many, many people over look is the Monroe Doctrine. States basically that only the U. S. can interfere with governments in the Western Hemisphere!"
Trudeau and Morneau are fiscally and economically inept and incompetent.

I saw a Fox News commentator say the opposite-- that Trump made a fool of himself with Acosta and should never be allowed to make public presentations-- especially to the press. I agree-- Miller has a loose screw and flips out losing his temper.

"Priebus is a partisan opportunist who put party before country every chance he gets. Kelly may in fact be an upgrade compared to him. Either way, more proof that Trump and Friends are as incompetent as they are crass."
"I'd bet that the overwhelming majority of illegal aliens in this country have some sort of documents. But I know - using the euphemism ""undocumented immigrants"" sounds so much better, if one is here in violation of our laws.

Still, I agree with you. Those who are here lawfully, having gone through the immigration process and been approved, should be allowed to stay. But wait - that's the present case.

I'm still waiting for those who advocate yet another amnesty (if you are old enough, recall the last, ""final"" amnesty that Reagan singed into law in 1986 - the one that would put an end to illegal immigration) to tell us how they would explain this to all those patient hopefuls standing in line for years and doing the right thing by our immigration laws. Stupid? Suckers? Losers?

Still waiting."

"I agree that you are ignorant.  Like I said many times now, learn to read.  Nowhere did I say I was not American.  What is your problem?  Are you a troublemaker or just plain stu*pid or both?

"Trump will get the ban back in place and keep those moslums out, hazzah!"
"This stupid so-called ""president"" said there were ""fine"" people among the alt-right protesters. He also blamed ""all sides"" when one of these same got into a car, and DROVE THROUGH a crowd of Americans, which is clearly another example of right wing domestic terrorism.


And Trump utterly flubbed what is probably the easiest thing to do politically - denounce Nazis. And gets all combative with the FAYYYYKKKK NOOOOZ when they are trying to get him to clarify and/or give him a chance to apologize and/or retract this...instead, doubling down on the hate."

"This president* is just the worst. Terrible president*. Cannot wait until he is gone. He simply has no idea what he's doing. He doesn't even seem to understand how to behave like an adult.

"I mean lets face it, They say only the good die young.  If true Hill-larious has many years left. If Hillary gets off the campaign trail, America will be better for it!

You will not pay any estate tax.  Zero $.  The first (roughly) $11 million left by a couple to their children is exempt from tax.  You really need to speak with an attorney or a CPA.

Trump is just part of a horrible and sleazy family.  Why on earth did America elect this fool?  It was a very reckless course.  WE all regret it now.
Why don't you call yourself dickhead instead of pubic ... good grief.
Bullshit story. The 3 killings are related. Some one making their bones.
"This is why we have Congress and the federal judiciary.  Trump will be stopped again on this latest of his idiotic ideas.

"Far far far more dignity than the current orange face orangutan sitting in the office now.

Why they had their faults as all leader do with some policy, they weren't full blown sexual predators, narcissists,  liars, and they all knew how to apologize when the time came.

You are nothing but tax sucking vermin.
You are sleaziest people around."
Lead contained entirely within the range and cleaned up at regular intervals?  /facepalm at your idiocy.
Actually I think that those who voted for him or support him are far bigger idiots than trump is. He is what he is and what he always has been and what he always will be. People who voted for him can't claim that he mislead them.

This vote is a Corporate Coup."
"Don't forget Trump Chumps are proven idiots. For example, assuming a convicted felon like say, Nelson Mandela or Ghanaian did poor quality work and made questionable arguments. 

Of course, Trump Chumps have nothing to recommend them, so it's important to them to find anything, something, no matter how small or irrelevant, with which to bully someone. 

You can't fix stupid."
"He sure did act mature, but his legislation and moves as C.I.C. were not good at all.  Some politicians can glaze over their lousy work and get this public thinking they were something great when they really weren't.

Trump's just a fool all around, though."
"But that's what you get now for minimum wage.

I guess inasmuch as you are a left wing, Trudeau worshipping troll, you'll get away with this moronicity here.

Pity."
"I cannot fathom the stupidity of McCain believing any cooperation from the (D)s.

"wow the ignorance of you left wingers never ends, that list was compiled by OBAMA and comp, which identified those countries as not trust worthy for documents and vetting given they have all but no functioning base government that can be trusted. thus the countries are in deed the obama policy put into action, , this is not about terrorist who did anything in the past, it is about vetting. get over your stupidity just for one"
"Can we safely call them 'losers '?.

You are a brainless 'celebrity' who supported the mass murdering communists in North Vietnam.  You add nothing to any debate and should keep you vapid mouth shut.  Stay out of our country you useless twit.

I'm praying to the narcissists Gods that they'll keep tRump on this steady plummet to the bottom where he  belongs.    Can the American voters really risk putting this Viagra popping buffoon on the national foreign policy stage and watch him stick his tongue out at a foreign leader when he doesn't get his way?  Oh the narcissist stars are aligning.
"From the article: ""many of the nominees delayed by Democrats passed easily and with bipartisan support"". So much for your two bit criminal allegation. 

Dems still can't get over losing the election to the most unpopular non-politician in history. They keep trying to relive November 2016, somehow expecting a different outcome. In grade school most people learned this is bad sportsmanship. Hillary should have asked the Dem Party if they would accept the result of the election, not Trump. Arrogant and hypocritical."
Then you are not the real Ronnie Ching.  I cannot help you in your ignorance.
And all the sucker fish are voting for Lying hillary...........
"Geez, how stupid can people be! Both Hillary and Trump are poor candidates for our President! AMERICA has never been great. That's just PR! A country that doesn't uphold the Constitution, people's Civil Rights, the First Amendment, protect the environment, provide jobs, healthcare, affordable housing for its citizens, equal taxation, etc, isn't great! But we always have that possibility. But not with Trump or Hillary."
"I'll ignore your ""stupid"" insult and reply anyway... 

No, the point isn't to be an average team that has a hot streak somewhere in the season that gives them a record where they barely hang on and steak into the playoffs.  The point is to be a good team PERIOD that can win most of their games not just during a hot streak anomaly, but throughout most of the season and in the playoffs.  You seem to have completely missed that nuance of my comment.  

Of course it's better to make the playoffs than not make the playoffs.  Of course it's better to have a hot streak than not have a hot streak.  But my point was that aside from that early hot streak, they were an average-at-best team for most of the season.  The early hot streak was the anomaly.  The sub-.500 team we saw after that is what they were for most of the season and heading into the playoffs."

Myself personally...I was not affected at all by any traffic his visit may have caused. As a lifetime resident and born-citizen of this state, I am truly honored that Trump chose to visit here and I hope he does so more often over the next 7 years of his presidency.

"How about, Stop Giving Trump So Much Free Press Every Time He Says Something Stupid?  The ""press"" is acting like a bunch of simpletons and Trump is cleaning up because of it.

Back in the 60's, populist revolutions were grabbing headlines:  Public action on the part of citizens gained control of a largely free press through direct action, and were able to use the media to disseminate vital information and spread revolutions that affected the way we view the environment, civil rights, and corporate wars---Revolutions that almost upset the balance of power, and made dubious characters like Richard Nixon into flaming liberals out of fear of the populace.

The Powers That Be learned their lesson then, and an increasingly consolidated media has been putting those lessons into effect with establishment-oriented messages and astro-turf movements ever since.  Now it's going the other way with Trump, and our 5th estate has turned into a bunch of drooling idiots."

No rational reading of my post supports this contention.  He inherited the scandal, and is responsible for how he handles it.  So far, he's protected priests from defrocking, failed to meet with victims, accused critics of being leftists and stupid people, has held no bishop accountable and created a commission that has no budget, no power, no mandate and thus can be recognized as a fraudulent attempt to be doing something."

"The now deceased shooter appears to be a deranged Bernie Sanders supporter. While the shooter is ultimately responsible for his actions, the mass media, Democrat leaders, and leftist ""entertainers"" contribute to a divisive, rabid anti-Trump/anti-Republican atmosphere which motivates extremists like this Democrat shooter.

The other big takeaway is that it would have been a massacre had there not been an armed security detail present to return fire and kill the assailant. High ranking politicians (including Democrats) have armed security details, but ordinary citizens do not. Hawaii Democrats deny ordinary citizens their constitutional right to self-defense with firearms, including concealed carry. Hypocrites!

And these are still not enough, they work very hard to invent a way to dig more from our pocket.

And governments attempting to tax fossil fuels up to an uneconomic price to make the other fuels look attractive is a fool's game.  It amounts to subsidising those fuels that are not yet economic.

This much is evident.  But claiming that Trudeau has wisdom and insight does quite follow.  The man is a fool, repeating his lines by rote."

As a narcissistic, egocentric, bullying and strangely personally insecure billionaire who inherited money from daddy and made money by cheating everyone with whom he came into contact, I expected him to do exactly what he did.

''welfare wasn't meant to be a career opportunity'' that is beyond specious, you should know good and well the abusers are the minority (most are white), and that assistance and the minimum wage was designed as more than a boost towards career opportunities. but corruptors made sure that soon became slave wages and assistance pathetically variable which put half the nation permanently in the poor house. their basic survival begat the need for welfare which have always been Dem led and supported while 'cons' have been at war against it all for many decades, except for corporations cos they're people too...

The flag represents precisely the right to protest peacefully and lawfully; for the POTUS to describe those who exercise that right in vulgar terms and call for them to lose their jobs dishonors the flag and the country and values it represents. It is the protesters, not POTUS, who honor the flag and understand what it represents.

Comey, as head of the FBI was investigating Trump's ties with Russia and possible (likely) collusion with Russia in interfereing in the election.  He was also investigating Trump's team.  You're dreaming if you think Trump wasn't directing them every step of the way. 

Trump is a pathological liar and unbelievably stupid.

I recall those perpetrators being released and having a parade in the Puerto Rican neighborhood of NYC.  I recall them being hailed as heroes when they returned to P.R.  I also remember well that there have been three elections in Puerto Rico.   The people had a choice of becoming a state (This would have required them to pay federal taxes.  They never paid a cent.) or to vote Independence or to leave things as they are (Get all the free stuff and benefits from the U.S. just as if the whole island was on federal welfare.).  And you think we have ignored P.R.  Hell man, they drove out the Navy which provided Billions to their economy and thousands of jobs and we ignored them?  What a misinformed fool you are."

The line of propaganda is crafted to appeal to those who have no view grounded in reality, those who are easily led to believe the exact opposite of any evident reality.

Trump/Putin can tell their followers up is down and they'll all chime in that anything else is fake news.

Truly wondrous, ‚Ä¶the extent of the indoctrination.

Trump can murder America in the street, (‚Ä¶and he's hard at it.),  and yet his followers won't lift an eyebrow.

They're too busy listening to Sebastion Gorka, or Alex Jones or some other equally crazy loon."
I love stupid criminals.
"Parnell refused the money, because expanding the welfare state is not financially sustainable.
 Both the state, & the feds are broke.

"my god you idiot libs are clueless thinking only Government owning and building is what works best,, we already pay far enough in taxes for such gov projects, we have overspending that is the problem, not revenue, get the house in order first befoer you beg to take more of my money"
Dumb and dumber
And the media who endlessly refused to call him on it and are now constantly at Trump's throat are even bigger hypocrites.
You're dumber than I thought......and that's sayin something. I'm sorry for you.
"As I said, ""emotional hugely ignorant..."""

"Damn..two weeks ago Comey was an upstanding, trustworthy guy.  Now that he is pulling his head out of his ass and doing his job, he is a partisan hack.  Someone should start writing his obituary, because they're going to find him suicided here pretty soon methinks."
The stupid just get more stupid. Truly pathetic. I wouldn't have believed people could be this stupid before the election. Now I accept it as an every day fact. And the stupid is growing.  How did you ever learn to read? Or do have a 6 year-old read to you and type in your response after minimally editing it for for you for spelling and grammar?
What kind of Crap is that?
"She must have been an absolute moron. I bet she fails to notice when to stop pouring hot tea, even after it's burning a hole in the top of her foot, too. She goes to the shoe store every week for new shoes because she can't find her old ones (that she's still wearing) and wonders why each week she needs a larger shoe size (so the new ones will slip over the old ones)."

They're every bit as bad as the far right wing nuts who take the same stance, not compromise. Drive by these extremes and get on with it."
"Actually, subscription revenue to the so called MSM --- New York Times etc --- spiked higher after the election.

My guess is that with a pathological liar now occupying the office of POTUS, people are beginning to realize just how important a free press actually is to democracy."

Scumbag.  Hope someone turns his a$$ in.
No the embarrasement is to the country when idiots who don't beleive in science because it is fake are appointed to important positions. Sad.
Whats pathetic is watching Liberal teet suckers strain for an excuse or deflect the issue and attack the messengers.    And watching wealthy business people make a mockery of   Liberal fundraisers involving the Prime Minister is top tier news so get over yourself.     $5000-$1500 = $3500 profit per person multiplied by ?     This stinks to high heaven.

"aa another ignorant left wing loser of stupid, i live in ontario nut job, i respect what trump is doing, i also call for leaders here to act the same, but our current crop of cult liberals is not up to it and dont care"

"What you refuse to accept, Mr. Conklin, is that this aina was taken illegally by haole business men of America who, like you,t believed they had the right as a superior, mightier race.  Racist in Hawaii was born from this one, historic act.  And for America's part in causing this sinful act of aggression, they apologized.  You however, and those of your ilk, are deaf, blind and dumb to this truth."
"The American people elected Clinton with a 3 million vote majority; the system elected Trump with Putin's help. How stupid are Trump supporters to believe this big, fat, orange buffoon should be President? Disgusting."

He finally achieved what he deserved: revulsion and rejection.

But I get your point, no need to be ""manly"", or a ""hero"". Not the best way to stay alive. As you say, stupid is as stupid does."
Yes. And you're a moron if you think so.
"That is absolutely ridiculous, as I pointed out in a comment above the government is based on a system of checks and balances, and the President must be held in check as well. He cannot wield unyielding power or else he is a dictator and equivalently as powerful and corrupt as someone like Putin. What he has done is put on a facade that all of you simpletons ate up, as you saw his call for less government and actual change. What you haven't realized in your blindness, however, is that he and a small faction of government officials have been taking complete control of government while forcing everyone else out. He's turning the country into a dictatorship and you should be frightened by that. He is violating ALL the principles this country was founded on, all because an uneducated populace wanted their racial, religious, and sexist bias' justified by a bigot far worse than them."
hissing?  yes they made themselves look like idiots just like the pathetic GOPtards.
General Mathis and Tillerson testified before Congress that it is better for the U.S to remain in this pact yet the idiot undermines them again. Time to use reverse psychology on the moron to get what we need.

"take terrorism lightly,  and it will eventually bite you in the arse!"
"How does it make sense for a free enterprise coalition to take over government as the Liberals did in BC? The results were disastrous. Now they want to do it all over again. Isn't it better for free enterprise to compete in a non-partisan environment and get contracts based on merit and track record instead of smarmy back room deals? The free enterprise coalition even robs free enterprise! As was clearly evident when Clark grabbed the NDP throne speech - the Liberals have no inclination whatsoever to act on behalf of public interests. They put us on the road to a fascist dictatorship. If big corporations are going to dominate government, then let them fold when the government folds. They are fools."
A rather stupid piece ...
"How is passing more pointless legislation and more stupid laws going to help if the existing ones were not applied by our useless government! Just like in the Las Vegas shooting, the perpetrator bought an excessively amount of guns in a very short period of time and the useless background check guy that is supposed to be monitoring this was asleep at the wheel. Great job useless American government, just great!

I doubt you even read the articles as it's far too easy to write ""how does garbage like this pass for journalism"" straight away once you know one of your enemy journalists has posted. There's nothing random about the tweets about #M103, They are real and mostly ""over the top"", but I won't see you complaining about ""garbage like this"" passing for commentary."
"What a bunch of IDIOTS. The most fair and COLLECTIBLE tax is a SALES TAX. 
The success of a tax is if it is widespread, can be enforced easily and is paid by those who actually purchase goods and services. 
The fewer collectors of a tax the better, and there are much fewer businesses to collect a sales tax than there are residents, who may or may not honestly pay an income tax There are a LOT of income tax cheaters and to enforce collection of income tax requires a new State agency. 
Auditing businesses who collect sales tax is very straightforward and very few businesses of any size cheat on sales taxes. 
As a person increases their income, they buy more expensive items, therefore they pay more sales tax, Most states eliminate groceries from sales tax, so as to not unfairly hit the poor, so the sales tax is on items people CHOOSE to buy. Rich people buy planes, expensive cars, expensive homes, expensive ""toys"", remodel homes, buy new appliances, etc. and therefore pay more sales tax."
An idiotic remark - how would you have felt if some dimwit proposed this when Obama was elected? He turned into a race baiting clown - still love him? He should have never made it to round one and because he did - should have been impeached as soon as he started supporting BLM and their domestic terrorism showing his true color....

"So the response is sympathizing with the poor nazis and their need to defend themselves.

This is beyond stupid. They showed up after a night march attempting to terrorize the town itching for a fight.

But lets just blame those that showed up to protest them. Lets throw down a ton of false equivalencies to attempt to make both sides look bad.

The permit for the event was revoked before it even started, the alt-right showed up loaded for bear and the police knew it was a riot not a peaceful protest. 

The fact that we keep even having this both sides are bad conversation when nazis are involved is simply amazing to me. They literally killed a person and everyone is hand wringing over the counter-protesters. 

Get a damn grip."
"America IS badly broken and was broken even before the fuzzy election of the yahoo Trump. Given the stranglehold of their defacto two-party system, they need(ed) vision, priorities and leafership that was not provided by Clinton and was thwarted from Sanders. Yes, there are mysoginists and idiots aplenty, but Renzetti needs to look beyond that issue to realize that Clinton and an elitist, war-mongering, conservative Democratic Party allowed the clown Trump to prevail."
"Trump needs to win
Trump is a limp dick and he's running foreign policy to look tough"
That is what people were saying about Trump idiot.
Only thing I learned from this election is that America is full of suckers and idiots and they all helped Trump win the white house.

And, everytime you try your hand at supporting that monster, you identify yourself as with him, a believer, supporter, advocate and enabler of all those things.  

A Trumpist, given to Trumpism, and therefore a supporter of racism, narcissism, elitism, sophistry and misogyny.

I know what it looks like when I see it on the TV.  It's ugly.  It has orange hair, flappy jowls, and a comical facial expression of attempted ""toughness"" that comes across as lame and buffoonish.

"I spent 8 years teaching women how NOT to end up in court - unless on the other end of an assault charge where they had ripped a shin or the lower lip, or smashed the two fine nose bones right into the brain... Toughest problem was overcoming women's revulsion at the simple yet very effective techniques.  I remember one young female idiot who insisted on walking through a dark park at night to get home. Said it was her 'right'. Sure enough, she was attacked one evening. She fought her assailant off. Never forgot her feminist arrogance. 
Speaking of which...
I can believe you were a lawyer who defended such idiots. No doubt you remember the true story about the NYC cop cross-examined in court by a Defence Attorney as to why he locked his locker at work if he really trusted his fellow cops? The cop's response: ""Sometimes lawyers walk through our locker room.""
Based on your 'arguments' and reactions on this site, I have difficulty believing it was the opposing counsel who were clueless."

"It's not surprising that the Victim Card is gleefully played at every opportunity by Islamist academics.

Her loss had NOTHING to do with the fact she was an awful candidate, a corrupt venal entitled puppet for Wall Street, an arrogant presumptuous psychopath, a two-faced lying hypocrite, none of these factors had ANYTHING to do with her loss--Why? you might ask--BECAUSE all these characteristics were obvious to all in the DNC who anointed her as the NEXT ""identity"" to become royalty--black, then female, apparently was the order of coronation by the Left--

The Media had already prepared their glossy covers with her crown in place--

The media still betrayed her--They could NOT ignore (as they had intended) the Republican candidate despite their orders--Trump played them like PT Barnum and they dutifully kept him FRONT and CENTER in the headlines--even trying to ridicule him as they did, Trump's name was in the news daily and the ""deplorables"" (those ignored by the mainstream parties) who were themselves ""mad as hell"" voted their disgust of party politics--hah, hah"
"Yes, seeing each other's face is part of communications, but it's not compulsory, nor should it be. Like most things in our society, it's a matter of freedom of choice.

"Thanks for your thoughtful comments, Hodor.

I think you‚Äôd have to be pretty stupid to want Trump to release those sort of things, don‚Äôt you? Tax returns will be fine for now.

Oh, and did you hear?? Apparently Trump‚Äôs new campaign manager (What, his third??) now says we‚Äôre NOT going to round up all the illegals and kick them out en masse as Trump promised. My guess is that Trump was just saying that sort of thing to begin with to attract the Palin-Americans he needed to win the primaries‚Ä¶"

Make all these idiots pay the cost associated with this. Make them clean up their own mess & give them a big fine. Why are we letting these people just do as they please. It is definitely sending a wrong message. Wake up you dumb politicians.
Just let them stay lost and post a sign at the trailhead of all the idiots that never came back. Put McCandless's name at the top of the sign.

You're a liar and you're stupid...
"Likely. But so what.  Information is out. President looks increasingly like a crook. Multiple disasters circling him. He is his own worst enemy. We all should watch the media. More news every day. Not Fake news either. Watch Fox. They are saying similar things as CNN about today's testimony. They can't believe how Trump has screwed things up so spectacularly in the last four months.

Doesn't all the evidence there now is grab your attention? Or are you simply one who thinks it is a conspiracy and that the investigation should be halted immediately. At the end of this, the people of the U.S.A. will not be ""thinking"" much about this single leak we are talking about. They will be wondering how they were ""so stupid"" to elect the self-obsessed egomaniac. And do to the anger and bitterness of his core supporters, the Republican Party will be torn apart. Do you want that?"
And this is why our system is corrupt because of stupid flipping judges.. smdh cuz you know if this was any of their damn children they'd get the max sentence and no plea bargain.
Drive the highway all the time. Too many reckless drivers and  rarely see any law enforcement. I would like to see a Trooper helicopter flying over in times of high traffic times and giving tickets out like crazy. The only thing that cures an idiot driver the real fear of getting caught.

If you've mowed down that many deer and other creatures then may I suggest that driving a truck isn't such a good thing. I've been driving for many a year and have yet to hit one even though I've lived in deer country for extended periods of time. I can usually avoid them but then in a sloth turning vehicle like a F350 I suspect that avoiding things isn't the easiest.  It's either that or you a crappy driver.

Now Christies` a Trump brown-noser.   THIS is the guy who rounded up and sent ""RGA"" money to Randy and the state party through the RGA PAC (""republican governor`s non-profit, tax free ""association"").

I'm sure everyone who lives in Anchorage and other cities would pretty much say your comment is stupid
This moronic hag just won't go away.
all true.  Trump's ignorance of world affairs combined with his recklessness has led needlessly to a possible world war.  Trump is the danger as much as NK.  We need major breakthroughs in diplomacy.  Military options should be off the table.  Trump lacks any capacity for diplomacy.  And is there anyone more pathetic than Pence strutting around in a over sized black jacket puffing out his chest.  Lord save us.

Obama was so bad that after essentially coming to an agreement with the debt ceiling and the budget with Boehner in a meeting at the WH.  By the time Boehner got back to his office Obama had left a message that he had changed his mind and wanted hundreds of billions more in spending.

"Wow, is Kelly really taking credit for this. Research the media coverage of the MGTF takedown on May 4th, 2017 where 52 members of the east side crips (including leaders and senior members of this gang) were indicted and arrested on Federal drug and drug conspiracy charges. They operated, lived and hung out in these boundaries as well as the Welton St corridor. I'm here to tell you Kelly had NOTHING to do with this. It's hard to do shootings and homicides when you're locked up. This violent organization was DISMANTLED on May 4th. Noelle, I can't believe you took the bait on this one. You probably covered the takedown on May 4th. Way to go! You and Kelly should be ashamed. How pathetic!"

"I'm appalled at some of you so called adults. You are attempting to humiliate and belittle high school students who have every right to be heard whether or not they agree with you. You are correcting their grammar and telling them to be seen and not heard. Acting like just because they are from a smaller community that they aren't smart enough to understand what is going on in the world. You are acting more like children than they are. These kids are being accepted to schools like Yale, Harvard, Stanford etc. South is an exceptional school academically and these kids are not dumb. Please, try to act like civilized adults and not talk down to or about children. I, for one am glad they are not learning from you because you are setting a horrible example."

You'd have more credibility is quoted Fox News.  But now I know how desperate you're getting to look sane around those who don't live in your MAGAphant bubble.  It's too easy making you look stupid.

You libs vastly underestimate the conservatives in this country. Keep up the criticism of every single move that Trump makes, you're digging your own graves."
"Come on damn it.  Hillary wasn't the best choice for the Democrats and I'm a liberal.  She never really had an economic plan other than chirping in her campaign stump, ""I'm going to turn the economy over to Bill.""  Geez.  Give me a back flipping break."

I had not thought of that aspect Dennis. I hope our military will have the courage to step in and prevent a world wide disaster. By step in I mean prevent Trump from doing something stupid if Congress won't act.
Kinda like your stupid remark!
The most idiotic read of the day. It can't get any better. Everyday daycare manners learned while studying leftist PC Ivy league gobble-de-gook.
My mom owned five duplexes in Juneau back in the 80's and 90's. She finally sold all of them because of exactly this problem. She tried to get better renters by simply pricing the low-lifes out by doubling the price of the rental. Always the same. She made her decision to quit the biz when she opened a door to a bedroom to find it packed with garbage bags to the ceiling. The dumpster was just down the street. Renter too lazy to walk there. She had to have the room gutted down to the floor joists and rebuilt. Pigs. Human pigs.

"Actually, fighting against Trump by preparing and filing ACLU law suits is great therapy.  We've been able to derail most of the idiotic things he tried to do, and throwing sand in the gears has been very comforting.  He's an imbecile and will continue to do stupid things, so I'm sure I'll have plenty of work to do.  

But thanks for thinking about me.  I never think about you.  Not ever."

"Sorry Political Junkie, but is it your *implied* argument based on these cherry picked data that climate change is a Chinese Hoax and thousands of hard working scientists are all lying to you? I mean, it SEEMS like you're implying this by comparing these storms to a 1935 storm, but you don't actually make the argument. Is that because you have no science background and only self-justifying interwebs resurch? Because you can't make the argument coherently so you ""JUST"" throw up a tiny tiny pinhole of data and smugly grin a if you've debunked thousands of studies over decades? 
It's pretty sad how many conservatives seem to think their untrained gut instinct or some facts some other con troll threw together on a blog are reality and thousands of scientists are a bunch of liars. 
I mean, here you are at a computer on the internet, relying MASSIVELY on science with every keystroke, but when they say something you don't like they're all liars? Fool."

Pelosi is too stupid.
I can't believe in a great country like this these are the best citizens we can find to represent our country to the free world. Both are childish and corrupt. I feel so sad for us. Trump is a conman. He has made and lost millions this way. That's all he knows. Hillary is a child. She will never truly take responsibility for anything. Trump is ultra right. Hillary is ultra left. We have no moderate. How can I make a choice with only these people. No 3rd party candidate has ever been elected to president to my knowledge. I saw an article somewhere that had 30 reasons Trump should not be president. Then it turned around and gave 30 reasons why Hillary should not be president. Trump's problems have been brought out and we all know every one of them. Hillary has a whole lot I had forgotten about. But both of them are not fit to be president according to the comparison. Only upset both parties have not done a reset and start over. Truthfully this is a Pandora box for both of them.
dumb old chump is going to game the system when he becomes president and become much wealthier.  he has already appointed robber barons including most of his family into key portfolio's of his new administration.  this blustering buffoon should not be trusted to day anything until it is actually done.
Such a loser and fool is the infested scrotus. Juvenile and childish don't begin to describe the behavior exhibited on a regular basis. Those who voted him in still haven't reached the embarrassment barrier and likely never will.

"The best thing Canada can do for its high tech industries is to vote out the likes of Junior, Wynne and Notley..  They are doing more to hurt the high tech and manufacturing industries that help it. They have imposed higher taxes on Canada's highest income earners.  Paying over 50% of your income on taxes is insane.   That effects skilled high tech entrepreneurs, managers, engineer, IT programmers, etc.  Already, the U.S. taxation is far lower for well-paid high tech staff.  More so for other countries like Ireland, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc.  That gap is going to get wider as Trump is going to lower taxes.  It now looks like Junior may impose higher capital gains taxes which again is stupid as many high tech staff count stock share options as part of their pay.    Combine that with carbon taxes and high energy bills.  .  That also badly effects manufacturing. Trudeau, Wynne and Notley are running huge deficits with no end in sight.  There is no end in sight with their stupidity."

"Dumb because it is obvious Assad never used chemical weapons.  It is clearly the rebels that have used chemical weapons, and not Assad.  Assad has a vast superiority in weapons, so has no need to resort to cheap weapons like chemical weapons, that are not very effective or easy to aim.  The rebels are the ones who don't have good weapons and have always been improvising alternatives like chemical weapons.  The UN can send in inspectors whenever they want, and they have never found any chemical weapons being used or possessed by Assad.  Why would Assad have turned over all his chemical weapons in 2013 if he intended to still use them?  Why would he bother using them at all, since he has much more lethal weapons?"

Why do people go to an area during hurricane season or to a war torn country and expect the government to bail them out. I would hope the individuals get billed for the cost. Being a Canadian should not mean you get a free pass to being stupid.

"""This was badly handled by stupid adults bent on humiliating this kid.""

You missed the point of the article.  The point is that, in this brand new age of phone cameras, social media, and other technology, NO ONE really knows what the right way to handle these tricky situations is.

Based on the article--if you have high school-level reading skills--none of the adults at the school were trying to browbeat the kid, none were trying to intimidate him.  Even the cop, who may have been the toughest on the kid, told him he could avoid having to go to court.

We do need to review any old laws about sexual activity among teenagers, and about the use of technology.  Both are changing quickly and constantly.  People's abilities to read and think should also evolve in pace with the technology."

Sad thing is they generally are just not intelligent.  We now have a president who is the opposite of intelligent.  A loudmouth who increases the volume whenever it gets a bit difficult for him.  This president has done nothing but shoot from the hip.  Sad that you are willing to tolerate it.  May I ask why?  Perhaps you now have a job building that 50 ft wall?  Or one of those manufacturing jobs that has come back to America?  Fact is there is no reason to support this clown.

My concern is not necessarily about the science or having policies in place to protect our environment.  My problem is with how you go about doing it.  The Paris Accord assumes all countries will comply with the pledges they made even tho there's no consequences if they don't.  Look at NATO.  Out of 28 countries, only 5 contributed to their defense as promised.  There are no consequences for the other 25 countries that violate the agreement.  Out of 194 countries in the Paris Accord, how many would you guess will comply with the agreement?  The U.S. for sure, because like NATO we are the stupid rich kid."

Weirdo.
"More thoughtless destruction by the GOP.  Instead of slowly torturing the ACA to death by cutting out vital parts of it, they should just repeal the whole thing. The people who voted for Trump need to feel the consequences of their stupidity.

"Read the US flag code and then you won't ask stupid questions. Taking a knee is as disrespectful as standing and locking arms.

As for my delicate sensibilities go, I am not offended in any way whatsoever. Football players, coaches and fans have been disrespecting the flag my entire life and it bothers me absolutely zero. Not standing and not placing your hand over your heart during the anthem doesn't bother me at all. The penalty for a parking ticket is a fine. The penalty for disrespecting the flag is nothing. Disrespecting the flat is meaningless.

Go ahead and melt pal."

The left knows no bounds for insanity.  They rival  Kim Jong-un every day for saying stupid things.  How dare this moron put Trump below that lunatic in N. Korea!  I hope they keep it up because sensible Americans understand we can't let a lunatic point nuclear armed missiles at us.  But apparently no position is too extreme for Democrats trying to destroy the will of the voters.   They are digging their own grave so I'll lend them a shovel if they need it.

Third is the Clinton Crime Family with it's inner circle of friends, who Colin Powell correctly identified as ""Hillary's Mafia""."

How reassuring that we have a fool for a PM who thinks just because he signed a farcical treaty where China promised to curb their theft, it will actually stop.

Everyone looks down at this clown the same way the world saw Neville Chamberlain waving his signed treaty with Hitler promising a comical pact of non aggression and halt of annexation.

Canadians have enough to worry about his latest tax attack on small business. He expects business and and everyday Canadians to assume all the risk knowing the Liberals will always get the majority of any profits made?

Cut everything that affects others, but clutch your special legislative privileges with a death grip.

You're a ""Conservative""? Ha! Well, let's take a look at your brand of ""conservatism"". First, you received tax-free per diem far in excess of your expenses every legislative day for two years, without any attempt to stop this fleecing of Alaskans. As you should well know, other state employees on long-term travel receive a flat $78/day, regardless of their food and lodging expenses. Special are you?

And poor you, having to maintain a home while you're away, not doing your job. Really? Did you even think before you wrote this?

Speaking of this, Alaskans elected and paid you to perform your  legislative job EACH and EVERY day of the legislative session(s), not to skip off to Europe, ""excused"" or not. Pay us back for that, too.

You (supposedly) can't keep track of your own income, and you are in charge of the state's?

"1. You're an idiot. I said nothing about medical care, and I wasn't talking about hunter/gatherers. It is a FACT that the first plastered walls were built by the SAME early farmers who also built the first grain stores. Agriculture allowed, for the first time, overproduction of food - so working for a few months a year would provide food for the rest of the year. Plaster was a major thing - it has ZERO survival value. It takes days of backbreaking labour, maintaining a fire at very high heat constantly - for no reward other than aesthetics. It's something that would never have happened in a society without an abundance of leisure time. And it's important that it did - the same fire-handling techniques they developed to make their walls smooth - was what allowed their grandchildren to smelt ore and end the stone age.
2. Yawn. I would have cared if it was related to the topic. Still a strawman.

Because you are white you reduce everyone else down to nothing but their ethnicity, denying them the free will and responsibility for their actions as individuals. They are de facto representatives of their race in your perspective. So yes Richard, you are a racist not because you speak frankly about the news, but because you cannot see past their color and are willing to blame an entire population for the choices of a few individuals. You are no better than BLM protesters who claim all whites are racist because the KKK exists, and actually you are much worse, because you are compounding a false narrative of white superiority that has plagued and eaten away at our democracy like a cancer since it's inception."

If the ""tapes"" he produces are legitimate, he's finished, regardless of his chief sycophant and apologist Paul Ryan, claiming, ""He's new at this"".

First of all there are numerous non-white role models in our society, like Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, president Obama, or Malala Yousafzai. The fact that 12 year old children don't list these people has more to do with what they watch and read today. Don't forget ""Bollywood"" which is a bigger film industry then Hollywood and generates (non-white) role models for billions of people. 

Canada has provided non-white people opportunities which they would not always have had in their home countries. Canada is a great country because we welcome these people and allow them to pursue their dreams. However, we should not start creating divide between white and non-white people."

Well, WHICH kind are you freaking talking about?  The Sunnis or the Shiite?  They've been righteously murdering one another since the 10th century.  And its getting WORSE.  WTF bro?

"Obamacare is not insurance but a bastardized version of socialized medicine attached to the insurance industry.  The only reason the insurance industry backs Obamacare is because it was supposed to force more paying customers to swell their ranks.  It also was to cover any losses that they incurred by insuring desperately sick people.  Unfortunately no one wants to pay their premiums until they are diagnosed with a disease or break a bone.  The idiot Democrats also forgot to pass the law guaranteeing payment for insurance company losses.  This billion dollar subsidy is what congress has been doing illegally since the passage of the ACA.  The Republicans want to stop these illegal payments.  
I do understand insurance and this is not insurance.   
Giving people permission to hate because you disagree with a policy position is wrong, immoral and unAmerican. You have also defended the shutting down of free-speech through violent demonstrations. Your intolerance is at least consistent."

Wow! I think she can get an annulment for that.   

Again, at least you're honest to admit it to us. When did you tell your wife what primarily--and primally--""drives"" your lovemaking? 

And how 'bout your kids? ""You're here because of Daddy's primal  urge to act on his sexual drive with Mommy""!

This is a woman who has no accomplishments and who used the fawning liberal media to build her up and erase her corrupt activities. But the American people saw thru all of it, and rejected her. Liberals, especially Hillary divide people along racial, religious and regional lines among others. Then she was beaten by the black guy (obama) and realized that blacks coalesced around Blacks because they are the most racist ethic group.  But women do not all adhere to gender politics. Blacks and gays are higher up on the liberal  totem pole than women. Hillary, the most unoriginal politician in the public eye, uses only focus-group tested cliches. There is no core, to this woman. She is as corrupt as they come."

You said that you were critical of Trump because he isn't doing what he said he'd do fast enough.  There's word going around that part of this decision is to take those measly dollars spent on care for trans folks and divert towards funding for the border wall.  Weren't we told over and over that Mexico was going to pay for the wall?

Ever wonder why despite Trump's rhetoric about ""locking her up"", he decided after the election to move on from prosecuting Hillary?  Have you ever wondered why we're back to Hillary again?

Do you enjoy being played for a fool?"

"These 'leaders' of Canada need to understand Islam's history.  They may start with Muhammad; a vile person who rapes girls, and claims them as wives.  His conquest of Mecca - how he agreed to a peace deal, only to attack later when his armies amassed.  And, 'Tacqiya'; religiously sanctioned deception, to achieve the upper hand.  Oh, yes, I know more about Islam, than the Muslims do! - that its purpose is control - through lies, manipulation and submission of all others by force. No; you cannot say this! - it is Islamophobic! - oh, how dear.   Why cannot we have a fair, and honest discussion, regarding the pitfalls of this horrendous religion? - because the Islamists will shut the conversation down with lies - whatever works...as is the case in Tacqiya.   And, while the conquest of Mecca was just  the beginning...  What about the Ottoman Turk empire? - 1 million slain, for not being Muslim.  And, the conquest of Lebanon? - Christians, and non-believers be damned...No; say NO! to Islam"

Yet the RG editors allow this sort of rot. Hillary Clinton is your compulsive liar, who has broken numerous federal statutes. Removing classified material is a felony, and that's for starters. Mrs. Clinton has said ""She doesn't remember,"" and gets to skate because of a corrupt federal government. Hillary Clinton also lied to the families of those who were killed in Benghazi, including a US Ambassador. Clinton and the administration knew it was an organized Al-Qaeda attack (on September 11, 2012! Imagine that!) but claimed to America and the families some obscure YouTube video triggered angry Muslims.

Instead of the howling from conservative Caucasian preachers about a black President being the 'Anti-Christ,' Donald Trump has become the most evil, divisive, selfish, corrupt, untrustworthy Machiavellian figures in modern history.

These preachers and their so-called 'religion' never got past the color of the President's skin. Ignorance and ineptitude are natural consequences of bigotry combined with fear."

"Well, perhaps you should ask the Canadian public if they want people who swear allegiance  to Allah over Canada in senior intelligence positions.  Sounds sensible to me.  Also, I just don't understand how you can be so hypocritical by constantly pointing out how racist Canada is while Muslim countries are the most oppressive human rights abusers on the planet.  I've lived and travelled there, and everything is racialized, women are hidden away, there's no religious or intellectual diversity allowed.  I don't like harassment at CSIS, but wouldn't it make sense to call out the far, far, far worse abuses in your culture and religion?  Or just live in a Muslim country if you think we're all so deplorable?"

On a recent hiking/fishing trip to ""Haena Beach"" or Shippman Beach.
true story.
 
On a Hot summer morning ,mid 80s about 10am in the morning. A white caucasian couple ,late 20's early 30s decides to take their 8-10 month  old baby on this arduous hike.  
 I see this and I'm thinking to myself,""Is it Me""? 
But,hello people, it's mid 80s now,but wait until it gets  mid day or early noon when it gets into the 90s not mention the humidity and the fact there is NO Water on this (5mile RT) Trail.
 C'mon people,think smart! Or we'll have more dumb politicians making stupid laws. IMUA!"
"During an anti-Trump protest in Seattle this weekend, an activist associated with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement took to the megaphone to voice her support for, among other things, ‚Äúkilling people,‚Äù and ‚Äúkilling the White House.‚Äù

Is this how you go high?  When did the Tea Party ever go this low?"
"""Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,"" the president said from the White House.

How stupid could you be??? The man is 91 years old and suffers from dementia. What good could it possibly do to put him in prison??? This is a tragic accident that has scared and devastated this entire family. Sorry you have no heart and are such a dick!!
There are more Trump supporters than brainwashed idiots on the plateau. If we wanted racism we would be Marching In White robes down 410. but we're not so wake up

"Hello out there!

Hello out there, members and supporters of Black Lives Matter Toronto!

My post has been up 15 minutes and not a peep from any of you folks.

So I gather then that you accept it: Your group provides a lousy role model for anybody noticing your group.

And, like cowards of the usual sort, you refuse to get involved in a fair-and-square confrontation here on this page.

I nailed it when I said it the first time: The Toronto Chapter of Black Lives Matter is that it is an organization comparable to a pile of unhelpful garbage."
Gee. Maybe they will finally go after the endless idiots with their arrogant driving attitudes blowing through stop signs and reds. And you tailgaters are a special kind of stupid. What exactly does that get you. What a bunch of mental midgets.
"The US does have a lot of morons, and they need a false god (or several) to worship. it is after reading her book Trump went on the ""Mexicans are rapists"" rampage."
"See?  I told you Mexicans are fat, and you called me a racist."
"HOW could Trump be 'worse' than a lying, murdering, thieving career criminal that takes bribes from countries that murder gays, treat their women worse than their dogs and stands by as Christians are murdered because they won't convert? Let's not count all the 'mysterious' or 'coincidental' deaths that have followed her since she was fired from the Nixon investigation."
"IS that what you think? Have you forgotten about the American invasion of Korea. Have you forgotten about the 50 years of brutal rule by the Japanese over the Koreans?

I think you must be a human turd. I will hunt you down you f**cker and slit your f***ing throat."
"These are disgusting charges and I don't respect the judgement of these girls' parents and nurses. You are not caring people. Give them each a week in the psychiatric ward, then let them apply for college. Weak stigma-based police state behavior on the part of idiots."
"Just another example of the mentally ill population that inhabit downtown , a useless bag of kukae that take out its frustrations on something beautiful to highlight a wasted life."
"References are constantly being made  that indicate that anyone that opposes Islam is a racist. Islam is NOT a race it is another religious cult, the same as the rest just a different flavour. We should be opposing all of them as they are a constant threat to society around the world. Its strange that we are allowed to use all our naturally endowed emotions except hate. Then we are criticized . If we hate pizza or broccoli that's ok but not a religion. That is ridiculous. Any sane educated person that follows a religion is in need of therapy. Islam just happens to be the current cult of violence and hating it is normal."
"u need to travel some jp. u r missing out on the creeping tide of islam. Michigan,  Minnesota for starters. Then get ur passport out and let us go to Dublin and then on to Jolly Olde England. I put up bub - With ur stupid comment - go travel and then tell me to shut up - ya twit."
"It certainly appears U/O President Schill has a mental disconnect of sorts. 

Schill write: ""But like the majority of my predecessors, I am also deeply committed to the principle of free expression, both as embodied in the First Amendment and in the institution‚Äôs tradition of academic freedom. Let me ground this conversation in the unequivocal statement that the UO embraces free expression as one of its core principles.""

Where as of late, Schill signed on the ""Blackface"" letter condemning a U/O law professor which in effect says "" your first Amendment rights does not matter"". 

What the heck is wrong with Schill? Is he addicted to the Hillary two step syndrome? Or is he just another reminder of the many grim failures of philosophical liberal cohesiveness.... in other words... just plain stuck on stupid?"
"Old stock are salt of the earth, the rest could only wish they respected gays and women half as much!!!

Another great reason for the death penalty!  Eliminate these morons who have no morals!
"Canada is smart but very stupid. The West innovates, Asia copies and then sells it back to us at half the cost because companies don't give a damn where they got it from and CEOs walk away with short term bonuses. Meanwhile we continue to buy iPhones and Galaxy phones while our kids drown in a mountain of debt. This is a short term tactic with long term consequences."
"you are an ignorant fool Allan - stop putting foolish words around the truth - the truth is I am not respected so I am just giving it right back.  Scared has nothing to do with it dear.  Clearly your ignorance knows no bounds and it is people like you who make this into an issue when there originally wasn't one.  You don't like it, too bad  We are all entitled to our opinion and we still have a choice.  I chose not to deal with her. Plain and simple."
"Prophecy was that the ""village idiot"" would start the next world war."
"Complete nonsense. This is the same way our asinine prohibition of alcohol ended, one free state at a time, while marijuana was federally illegal. No state is required to mirror or even enforce federal law. If that were the case we wouldn't even need states, the tenth amendment, or any laboratories of democracy. Thankfully the founders were a bit more intelligent than you. We the people have spoken, the prohibition of marijuana is a cancer, and it will be cut from this state like the garbage it is."
"The issues you cite are total petty nonsense! As you are well aware, Comey cleared HRC back in July:  ""our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case... we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts.""     

Like Bernie, I am ""sick of the  da@m emails"" and we need to be discussing important issues.  Trump is an inexperienced,  racist, and misogynist  who is totally unfit to assume the presidency.  Election tampering tactics are a serious threat to our democracy, and they are illegal!"
what a loser asshole
"Well lets see here Socialist. We have millions of illegals in the US. they cost us billions. 10,000 people to clean that up is well worth it. NPR is just a liberal propaganda outlet. Pay for that crap yourself"

So what you are saying is that Canadians are too stupid with a short attention span to understand this?
"YOU are the people who have handed him the bullhorn. YOU are the people willing to embarrass this nation and put it on the brink of economic ruin all because you wanna throw an electoral hissy fit. YOU are the people who want to revolutionize the way America does business by voting for its worst businessman, a disgusting neon pig who only makes money when he causes problems for other people instead of solving them. YOU are the thin-skinned yokels who clutch your bandoliers whenever someone hurls the mildest of slurs at you (‚Äúdeplorables‚Äù), while cheering Trump on as he leaves a bonfire of truly hateful invective everywhere he goes. YOU are the people willing to overlook the fact that Trump is an unqualified, ignorant sociopath because DURRRR HILLARY IS BAD TOO DURRRR."
Ignorance must be bliss for you.
Lets outlaw guns!! We need to. Look at what making heroin illegal has done. I bet AK does not have a heroin problem!! IDIOTS!!!

"Enough already with this incompetent, corrupt, asinine, completely self-serving, unaccountable, non-transparent, untrustworthy, LYING ""circus"" called the Trump campaign OR the Trump Administration!  Given this latest ""revelation"" by Trump's son with its corresponding email trail, I thought for sure this latest ""revelation"" would have warranted immediate federal charges being filed by Special Counsel Mueller and his team, against Trump's son, his son-in-law and Manafort (and charges against other Trump actors for other blatant illegal BS!) for illegally conspiring with a foreign power in a ruddy illegal attempt to unduly influence the outcome of a US federal election in favour of candidate Trump over his rival candidate Clinton!!???"

If you were smarter you would see just how contradictory that is but there is nothing we can do about that. Ignorance is curable but what you have is genetic."
"Excellent, still going to try to agitate for WW3 before Trump gets in and Canada is involved. Great stuff. Nothing wrong with this picture at all. Does any of this make sense? Russia and Assad are fighting off all the enemies. You are actually trying to convince me they are more concerned about more ""moderate"" ""rebel"" threats than a more serious one. Nice try criminals!"
"Trump sure seems to be able to get away with a lot more bigoted, racist, bullying, and generally offensive statements that most users would be allowed.

Well, maybe not, Twitter seems to set the bar low, and I don't have an account so I'm just guessing, but I read Trump's tweets this morning, with his ""Pocohantas"" comment on one, and a reference to a human being (albeit not a very nice one, even by Trump's standards) as a ""degenerate animal"" in another.

To say this sort of thing is un-presidential is a gross understatement, but more to the point it's offensive, and coming from Trump, it's actually dangerous.

On the other hand it's mildly entertaining the way it might be watching a zombie apocalypse versus a threshing machine or something. Sad and brainless."

Trump says stupid things.  Hillary does stupid things that get people killed and other things that are felonies.
In fact this sort of activity is one of the ONLY duties a proper Constitutionally limited federal government should be performing.  This idiot is no different from every other leftist idiot. For them it's complete government control or nothing.  They don't understand the Constitution at all.

"Keep in mind Hillary actually garnered 2.5 million more votes than Trump.

And he's right about the big time trouble. Keep in mind there is a little agreement called NAFTA still in place that prohibits what Trump is doing.

"Gain, Trump makes another stupid move.  You probably know that carpenters generally don't make good surgeons.  Likewise, senior (as in old) senior (cheap general - like Brigadier) military let overs don't make good gate keepers for Presidents who don't listen.   A couple of months at best.   Then Flynn can do a more worthwhile job looking after his grandkids."
"""I prefer the ""European socialist nanny state"" as opposed to a 3rd world nation or having us look like Russia and China that the GOP is driving us towards"".

That is just an asinine statement. Trump is giving this nation back to the people. I can't understand how there are still people who believe in that ever illusive socialist utopia. Socialism defies human nature there is no way in hell people bring out the best in themselves when the results is to remain the same as everyone else."
Stupid things happen when naturally (literally) ignorant people show up in nature. Lightning doesn't happen enough to them.
"Since you are not a nun, you therefore declare yourself insane and not qualified to comment. Clearly the content of your ""commentary"" (more like a slogan) and styling are an indication of insanity. That's how liberals deal with the world, they shoot themselves in the foot, time and time again. 

Liberals support ""race politics""  and so close the door on rational debate. Politics becomes a football for racialists and revolutionaries calculating redress and measuring imbalance. Liberals practice birth control, which ensures they will not spread their luciferian doctrines beyond this benighted generation. Liberals thrive on the largess of a functioning society, so of course they do what they can to undermine and dismantle the very civilization that tolerates them.

Liberalism is a disease of the wealthy and idle elites, much as Enlightenment was the disease that spelled doom for the Middle Ages. Every civilization has a healthy ascendancy and a sickly decline. Liberalism is our swan song."

"My comment is, did you ALSO comment on the inflammation of race relations caused by Obama, Holder and Lynch?  If not and you are only commenting about Trump, using the BLM standards, you must be racist since you did not publically criticize an African-American but you criticize an Anglo-American. It used to be it was simply called being a hypocrite, but since using BLM has determined that if you treat someone different (albeit the real reason is based on their opinion and not race) if the subjects are of a different race, then your criticism must be based on your own inherent racism."

I certainly don't have any such expectations of him!

That would be like expecting the same thing of Romney or any Kennedy or FDR or  Kerry or Pelosi or many of the multi-millionaires who currently constitute over one-half of the Senate and one-half of the House of Representatives!

That would not only be stupid, it would be ludicrous in the extreme!"

"It would be nice if America woke up but the dem. party marketing, with the support of the main stream media have successfully indoctrinated their voters. No amount of evidence will sway the loyal subjects,   no amount of corruption will the loyal dem. voter allow to get in the way of their support of who they have been told to vote for. It is so sad to see the puppets dancing to the dem. leaders, or maybe calling the dem. leaders puppet masters is more appropriate.  There is no fool as big as the fool who has allowed themselves to be continually used despite massive evidence they are being played as a fool. The dem. party is full of fools."
"A friend once told me ""Think of how dumb the average person is, now realize that half of the population is dumber than that!"" That proves more and more correct every time I think about it.
Friends and I were camping last weekend in Pingree Park, 4wd trails everywhere, all the fun you could possibly want in a jeep, quad or bike. Towards the end of the day we're sitting at our campsite and watch some guy on a quad go off the trail and go tearing through an untouched meadow. 4 of us went running down the hill to yell at him about it. The obligatory answer of ""Sorry"" came back. You could tell he didn't care, he just got caught. Earlier in the day we'd cleaned up a shooting area of 400+ spent shells and casings that people left behind before we got our own gear out. It's BS like this that ruin it for everyone. Soon you won't be able to do anything anymore. People are idiots and jerks."

He went on to try and pass the blame on Monica Lewinsky...""I used the exact same term she used during her testimony and statements.""

"Do not forget Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.  President Trump selected him from the preferred list as he promised.  He unblocked Obama's idiotic pipeline shut-downs as promised.  He has undone hundreds of Obama's destructive executive orders as promised.  If the congress could get its act together he is ready to disappoint you even more by keeping his promises.  Just because you hate his policies and thus his guts, there is no need to impune his political truthfulness."

"What a load of crap. Our problem isn't culture or a lack of an organized moral code that we all believe in, which never actually existed in the past. We are suffering from a mass political failure to deal with serious US problems, mainly economic. So the problems continually pile up, and now we don't trust government and fight among ourselves. Class war."
Hopefully our idiot AG will quit throwing taxpayer money at this and fight CRIME like he is supposed to!
"Wall mismanages the budget and then goes after the workers to repair his incompetence. Only a dumb con would accept that.

Wall rode the oil boom for a while; he will ride out on the oil bust."

By the way, moron, if these meetings were really nothing, why did they stay hidden for so long?  Like this whole Russia thing, if nothing's there, the baby-in-chief should move on, do his job and ignore it.  However, sane people (not you MAGAphants) pretty much have concluded that ""where there's smoke, there's fire.""  When someone acts guilty, they usually are.

Worst President Ever.  No one even comes close.  History will be correctly brutal and cruel to Trump.  He's a pathetic failure, along with the rest of his administration."

btw, civilbeat, Tim's comments were acceptable, this stupid censorship needs to go!"
It has less to do with the Liberals abandoning their principles and more to do with letting the public see in the clear light of day the NDP and the Greens voting against the very platforms they campaigned on in a naked grab for power.  Now that's hypocrisy in action!
"This little man, Justin, should resign now to stop the embarrassment for Canada.

""I don't understand the concerns being raised so I'm just going to blindly claim it is due to fear and be done with it"".

Question for Mr. Clark, why is our government passing *ANY* piece of legislation that singles out a single religion?  Canada already has enshrined, in our Constitution, religious freedom as well as protection from discrimination based on religion.  We already have anti-hate laws and even terrorism laws to protect against religious persecution by individuals.

This is a pointless piece of legislation that will, at best, result in a waste of money.  All we need to do is enforce laws that are already on the books."

And I am not claiming anything except the Donald is just not presidential.  He is an embarrassment besides being extremely stupid."

Call out the National Guard!   Shoot if necessary.
More pathetic Democratic sniveling.  Get over losing the election and go on with providing meaningful legislative solutions to a tired and over regulated system of government.  Maybe some members of Congress should be recalled by their constituents and turf ed out.
Glad it's a fucking joke to you .
And they died defending a persons right to protest. I spent over 22 years in the military. I find the phony patriotism exhibited by Trump to be hypocritical.

"Haha!

Your first link tells us the USA is 9th on the list of the world, in IQ. I always thought, WE'RE NUMBER ONE!
Ooops!

Then your list from US News, is just some reporters extrapolation of the estimated IQs of presidents going back to Washington. Did they even measure IQs in the 18th century?  This, I'm afraid, falls into the category of ""junk science.""

In any event, when it comes to ranking presidents, W. is pretty far down the list. Lower than Carter, Nixon, and Kennedy, among others, but ahead of Reagan. Ooops!

The story is  about the  misguided dumb Millennial, escalating condo sales higher, hiding a real deterioration in the broader market.

As is Drumpf a lying gasbag.
"The Liberals should listen to the economic experts and dramatically increase immigration levels (at least 500,000 per year). Stop listening to the loser racist trash."
"You are so full of crap,  is he legal or not, that is the question,  if the Obama administration didn't like the law he should have spent the time changing it instead of a bs health care program,  the liberals will continue dragging out the sob stories for the next 8 years."
O'Leary is a buffoon.
"vagrant criminals, social parasites leeching off welfare, and liberals."
"Reminds me of that saying...
""I'm not saying we should ki11 all the stupid people - I'm just saying that we should remove all the warning labels and let things work themselves out"""
Useless activity.  Silly.  It changes nothing.  Try some relaly creative diplomacy for a change.

"Truly, a really beautiful moron"

""No role for Assad, his family in Syria‚Äôs future""

Is everyone in the Trump government a complete id$ot?

There will be a role in Syria's future as long as the Russia says there will be a role for Assad in Syria's future. The Americans and certainly NOT Trump have a voice/say in this conversation/matter.

What uneducated, redundant morons have the Americans become...........
."
here we go again the hypocrite mayor with his forever damaging cement the rest of the aina programs wants to put a fake on the public with his call for a total plastic bag ban.
"These jerks have always been around. Trump being President has given them the go-ahead to reveal themselves in all their odious, disgusting and collectivist glory."
"Somebody is making money off this mess.

What are the odds that someone, with knowledge that the deal was crap, shorted the stock?  Short 100,000 shares and the price drops $5 a share, and you are ahead a cool half million dollars."
GET THE 47% OFF THEIR ASS AND DO SOMETHING. EVER THINK OF THAT.
If we banned the words idiot and moron there would be no way to describe these m----ns
"lil mikie pence who destroyed his state with draconian measures is weighing in on another thing he knows nothing about...THE MAN IS DUMB.....so is his furher PUSSYGRABBER/PUTIN....they didn't get their talking points straight before trying to 'grab you by the back of your head, pulling you closer to their d**k to s**k....DON'T DO IT!"
AK Jen - Russia is no longer a communist nation. Stop spouting that -  it makes you look stupid.
"What an idiot, do these guys ever stop and think about what they doing?"
"wow you really are an ignorant hater .. NK has in deed been threatening alot of the world and you think its a fantasy??? , thank god you are not in charge.."
Gosh...with that much history why would you get yourself pregnant by that animal for the 2nd time?
It is possible someone who did not agree with your comment killed it just to be a jerk.   Eg. Liberal vs anti-Liberal.
"What exactly is Obama's record in the ME?

Genocide in Syria? Lousy deal with Iran helping Iran to promote terror in Syria and Yemen? In 3 weeks he will go disgraced and disrespected by all parties in the ME.

The last bark of the mediocre President"
MORON.
"This has been going on for the last 20  years.  Ever spoken to an even  middle-level bureaucrat?  Only thing any of them think of is their pensions, and how to preserve their budgets.  Morons from top to bottom."
"The Nuggets would have been idiots to put together your idiot package for Butler.  Chandler, Murray, and Barton? 

Too bad nobody is getting in line to take you off the Post's hands Kiszla...."
So hillarys ethics Are much higher then trumps? Both are dogs i think i want the one that bites less.
Neyman is a good journalist. I wonder why she slimed her reputation with this crap.
This proposal is so idiotic that its failure is imminent.
Hiding behind a nickname while calling Trudeau a coward. Ironic isn't it?
Why the hell didn't someone shoot his ass?
You would have to be really stupid to draw that conclusion.
"No: you inflated sense of yourself not withstanding, you didn't force me to do anything -- any more than I forced you to describe Trump as an a-hole. But you have caused me to change my mind about your claim that you are a lawyer. I think you probably are a lawyer. For you, winning an argument seems more important than telling the truth. For you, threading the needle between ""liar"" and ""bullsh*tter"" is more important than acknowledging that Trump's tweet was reckless and irresponsible; that he accused without supporting facts or evidence; that not caring whether something is true is the moral and functional equivalent of lying; that Trump has lied repeatedly in the weeks following the tweet.  You say that you think he's an a-hole; but that's easy and has no content. do you recognize him as reckless and incompetent? Or are you using a-hole as your shorthand for reckless, incompetent and dangerous?
A drunk clinging to his empty gin bottle: Agree?"
add the leap manifesto stupidity and it is guaranteed dead on arrival.
"""butt-hurt leftist wackos,"" ""butt-hurt liberals"", I don't even know what such trite, asinine references are supposed to mean but after reading Silvers offensive, ignorant rambling diatribe, it is not worth spending any time trying to figure such drivel out."
"Linda, I'm glad you ended up with Cliff. What a flipping nightmare. As a mother that knows you and your children I find it hard you'd participate in Cliff's disgusting behavior. Makes me feel sick. Amazing what you did for money.. Guess you and Cliff can now live ""happily, ever after. . 2 sick fucks. üò±üò±"
"Jantjies must go, I agree. Gets caught with ball too much, hardly ever breaks, not agile or fleet footed. 
The game was lost however by one mans stupidity, D'Allende, who is also showing none of his early brilliance. In fact, our centers all around are lacking, and it's not form. They seem to think they're battering rams.
Etsebeth was brilliant, but I hope the captaincy doesn't detract.
An altogether better performance as a whole."
How much did the silly secularists spend to conclude that human life originated with star dust and pond scum?
"What an idiotic comment. 

Do you consider the fact that $15 / hour in Toronto is not the same as $15 / hour in North Bay. Wages in smaller communities are generally lower because the cost of living is less. This is gong to have a negative affect on smaller communities.

Apparently we have a Toronto centric crowd here  hat cannot conceive of living anywhere else."
How much longer does this country have to suffer this disgusting moron as president?
"Totally agree. Not to mention that shopping around tax returns is a felony for whoever gave it to the NBC. The NBC could not legally release the vagina tape, so, as we recently learned, they leaked it to the WaPo to derail Trump's campaign. New low for the media."
"Why not get rid of these 2 idiots. Take out back of the Capitol & tar & feather them, maybe a few lashings at the stake, maybe waterboarding to learn about what complete assholes they are!"
I would bet a week's salary that Jim Minnery's organization will get more donations and funding if this bill passes. He's a liar and a hypocrite.
"the mayor and his lackeys could have used the wasted 4 million they spent on the defunct bike share program to fund more important things...oh yeah, the tax payers / homeowners get screwed again."
Compare the statements of support from the local native people to the idiot statement from the center for biological diversity.  Who do you think knows more?
And you are the one who wants to eliminate anybody who does not agree with you. Its really the same sort of thinking. Intolerance. Bigotry. Pathetic
"I believe  there are more felons out there that have more weapons than the good people in society have...........

The SOLUTION:  Build more jails and keep these IDIOTS out of society, FOREVER..................."
"WOW!! Can't believe it is still that high. The contempt these Provincial Liberals have towards the private citizens footing the bill for their money squandering ways is absolutely disgusting! When the province is being dismantled and ran into the ground there is no better example then recent quote from Liz Sandals about Go Train riders as well as idiot Glen Thibeault telling families  deciding between paying hydro or food and small businesses pleading for relief to go spend $10 to $30, 000 upgrading homes and businesses to higher efficiency lighting and equipment. ABSOLUTELY SICKENING AND DISPACABLE PEOPLE!! They are pretty much everything I am trying to raise my kids not to be."
"The ""human rights"" squad need a swift kick in the derriere."
"Typical idiot democrat ""solutions"". Grow government. Add a new department full of HGEA union members. 
Look, if it's to the point that the idea of an armed, additional law enforcement agency is needed, WHY DON'T YOU ENFORCE THE LAWS ALREADY ON THE BOOKS with the assets you already have?
Most of HPD are proud of their city and want to keep it clean. Untie their hands, and let them enforce the law."
"What a pile of rubbish. Sure, hang in there ""a little longer theres a fair chance even you might see the light."" The one at the end of the tunnel. The drumpt train of boorish depravity."
"stupid is letting some one  develop our resources, and paying them to do it. and they make all the profit. stupid is is stupid does. lets keep giving our resources away, STUPID"
That's OK - Liberal's double down on the stupid by bringing them to Canada instead.
"Blah, Blah, Blah. The Obama administration sucked, end of story."
Keep hiring imbeciles like this jerk and you will end up with a no firearms for rent-a-cops bill next session.
Asshole.
"Calling tens of millions of voters ""deplorable"" or ""stupid"" (because they voted for the other guy) is condescending. 

But hey, feel free.  It's working so well for you guys."
"""molesting his own daughter and betraying America to Russia""
The first part of that sentence makes you a disgusting liar. The second part makes you galactically stupid."
And that would have been the best course of action. Pit bull owners pull this crap all the time.
There ya go. Stupidity to the max.
"Sanders has balls unlike Treyson Goowdy.The Gowdy is a blow hard, has done nothing.What a loser"
"It's really hard to say this since there are so many, but this might be the dumbest thing you've ever said."
Saying the strategy will work quickly is epitome of stupidity.
"Trump Bunnies:  You can't fix stupid.
Fact, proven over and over every day."
"hey loser change your name to something more accurate, as in alt left ignorant for life!,, unlike the dems who take their money from soros or wall street as well,, save it loser you lose again. this is about fixing the mess obamacare created"
And you are a complete moron who obviously doesn't know the meaning of the word narcissist. By the way your bias is showing.
"Such vitriol from the left.  Who would have thought these open minded, tolerant people could be so vile and hateful? It so exposes you all for what you are, hypocrites."
It is now time for most of you to expand your pebble minds.
"Why does this author think she can demand, or is owed anything from either of these two people? One guy is a goon, the other is illiterate. They aren't law makers, teachers, or in any kind moral authority position. They are entertainers who get punched for her pleasure, and will likely live out their days mentally debilitated from the repeated blows to the head.

Do we get to comb deeply through this authors personal history and determine all the groups she owes apologies or explanations to? Why not? As an opinion maker in a national news paper and instructor of young people, she has far, far more influence on Canadians than two ignorant punchies.

The arrogance of these pseudo-intellectual academics is astounding. Since they are so enlightened and pure, YOU owe THEM an explanation and an apology as to why you're so dumb and ignorant."
