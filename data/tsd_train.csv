Anyone and everyone. This is a community problem, so everyone who wants to be part of the solution should be allowed to help. As I said above: remove all protections on free ranging cats, and allow people to help. People who allow their pets to roam outside are part of the problem, because their pets are part of the problem. It would be very sad if pets were killed, but ultimately it is the owner's responsibility to make sure their pets are not out killing birds.

Years ago some Vermont acquaintances got one warning from the Ranger: Next time I see your dog running deer, I'll shoot it. Next time she saw it running deer, she did. 

Vermont does not pretend that trapping, neutering, and releasing dogs solves any problems. They are serious about threats. We just want to feel good about ourselves. If we were serious about feral cats, we would kill them. Neutered cats eat birds. Don't release them. Kill them."

I don't know what will happen, and no one knows. But one thing I do know is what goes up quickly goes down quickly as well. Look out below when the bottom drops out, not if but when. The fundamentals can only be submerged for so long. 

There will be those who believe otherwise. That the Canadian economy is just wonderful. But as another writer has pointed out, the Canadian stock market has gone nowhere one/ten years.

But ""domestic abuse"" is idiotic--and misleading, and a misrepresentation. It is not domesticity that is being abused, nor is it ""domestics"".

It's assault within a partner relationship--and even that's a bit slippery: typically, it's woman-battering.

People were called racist for making racist comments, which of course were simply considered anti PC remarks by the racists. That's the racist way of being PC, ironic as that is, and it kind of brings us back to the ignorance thing, again.

What can be said about this ignorant woman... & the fact that she is using 'Indigenous' as a slick byline in order to spew her maladroit, racist garbage which can not get any more pathetic than her 'Look at me -- Look at me' superiority complex?

How this chick is being taken seriously* is simply beyond the pale.

There are many Indigenous Canadian Citizens who do not buy into this phony use of them to promote the 'Reba/Usery-Like-Agenda' of this ever-so-holy woman with the foul mouth.

Regardless of how the discussion of 'Cdn Indigenous Peoples' has been framed by the 'empty barrel' selfie-eager PM, JT, a great preponderance of the Cdn People love our Indigenous Cdns... Always."

A flat economy in 2019, more moronic and embarrassing behaviour by Trudeau, a huge accumulated debt,  more broken promises and at least a modest revival of the NDP will make the Liberals vulnerable.

He was described on the programme by people who knew him - devoid of human empathy, utterly ruthless. One person said they certainly experienced evil when in his presence. Decent business people (and some not so decent) wouldn't touch him with a barge-pole.

What they found most disturbing was that Trump met him then told his people, ""I want that guy working for me.""

They also showed Trump in an interview stating that 'Its all about genes."" It was like interviewing someone from the Third Reich.

Regardless of the reason, telling people in a country that has been attacked three times in less than three months by Islamic fanatics “not to be alarmed” is the height of irresponsible stupidity.

There are indeed so many citizen see-something say-something reports of Islamic nut jobs that need watching, this tsunami of citizen reporting has totally overwhelmed the resources of MI5 and British law enforcement. There are no near term prospects of things getting much better either, not until major budgetary outlays can be conjured up to massively expand law enforcement resources in the UK.

Those who seek to blame all this on our PRESIDENT are merely confessing to have succumbed to TDS (Trump Derangement Syndrome) and should seek psychiatric intervention.

Bottom line: until the UK quits molly coddling fanatics who are the source of this problem in the feel good pretense of “diversity”, more British blood is going to flow."
